          <p>
            I'm currently on my third year studying a bachelor's degree on software engineering at <a href="https://www.lut.fi/web/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUT-university</a>.
            23 years old, I've always been passionate about all things IT, and introduced myself to programming when I was as young as 13.
            I especially enjoyed making all sorts of games, which I still love doing on my free time.
            <br><br>
            During my years of studying I've gotten quite comfortable with development work and have learned the most common and useful tools
            on both the front- and backend, including ReactJS, Node.js, ASP.NET, Express.js, etc. I've also touched on Azure DevOps on my last summer internship at <a href="https://www.miradore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miradore</a>.
            <br><br>
            I'm keen on improving my skills very actively, and have
            been working on a number of personal projects, as well as participating in
            as many hackathons and code camps that I've had the time for, including
            the Visma 2021 React Code Camp, and the Finnish Game Jam
            2019-2021.
            <br><br>
            At the moment I am working on my bachelor's thesis about constructing artificial intelligence for video game purposes, especially focusing on simulating economies.

          <h3>Miradore</h3>
          <h6>Software Developer Summer Intern, 5.2021-8.2021</h6>
          <p>
            I was a part of the Maintenance & Development team working with a large-scale device management software on both the front- and backend.
            Towards the end of my internship, I was trusted with more demanding
            tasks including working with the software's database and contributing larger changes and additions to the end-product.
            I got some valuable work experience in my field and learned how to better work as a part of a development team.

            The classic fast food job after mandatory military conscription. Due
            to my interest, my employer taught me about the logistics and
            operation of the restaurant on a larger scale. Although the work was
            quite repetitive, I did enjoy interacting with customers!
