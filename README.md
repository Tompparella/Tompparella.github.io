Contains my work for a course in front-end development.

Programming in CSS is done via SCSS, and in order for conversion to work the command 'npm run sass' has to be run before saving changes.
The page is deployed via github pages, and to deploy the latest version the command 'npm run deploy' has to be run.

The page is designed with site responsiveness in mind, meaning that it resizes and changes based on the user devices' screen size.
The site is deployed in github pages and can be accessed from url: https://tompparella.github.io/my-portfolio/
