          <p>
            I'm currently studying information technology in LUT-university.
            I've always been passionate about all things IT, and started
            programming when I was as young as 13. I especially enjoyed making
            games, which I still love doing. Unfortunately, due to me living in
            a small rural town, I lacked the tools to further my skills. Now
            that I'm studying the subject I love, I aspire to learn all that I
            can and become the professional in my field that I've always dreamed
            of.

          <h3>Aslakin Liike</h3>
          <h6>Gym Assistant, 8.2017-3.2018</h6>
          <p>
            My job revolved around keeping the gym tidy, working as the cashier,
            helping customers, as well as managing orders for the small retail
            shop of the gym, which I did largely voluntarily.

          <h6>Fast Food Worker, 26.6.2019-25.8.2019</h6>
          <p>
            The classic fast food job after mandatory military conscription. Due
            to my interest, my employer taught me about the logistics and
            operation of the restaurant on a larger scale. Although the work was
            quite repetitive, I did enjoy interacting with customers!

          <h6>Lumberjack, 8.6.2020-25.6.2020</h6>
          <p>
            My job was to plant tree saplings for about a month in regions
            around Kittilä. The work was physical but I enjoyed it. I also drove
            as the designated driver of my group. I chose to work this job
            instead of seeking a job in my own field because of the coronavirus
            outbreak of 2020, as well as the pressure from my own projects and
            university summer courses.
